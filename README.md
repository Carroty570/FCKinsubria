    Wellcome, bienvenutto or bem-vindo,

   This is a Github repository for the args from INF course in INSUBRIA, till now there are
the firts 6 months of lessons here.

1. We gave our prio on Programmazione, cause it is basically the main subject in this initial 
route

    Here you can find the exercices done by Murilo and Matteo (Il coglione) till now Of course,
all in java. The codes are on those folders on your left, so enjoy.



    !Minimal Presetts!

        - Java installed ofc
        - An IDE pre installed and setted, we are using and we recomend VScode, cause it's easier
        to integrate with github, but you can use any one you want (Eclipse, Intelijj 4 exemple)

        -  On some theory filles will be in pdf, we recomend you to instal the extention "vscode-pdf" 
        on you VScode, it will help to visualise your pdfs.

        - We are using this repository to share the information and divide the work, we think that
        this is a easier way to go throght the course, teamwork fellas

        - If you are new here, fell free to create your on folder on LEZIONI, with or name, and
        use this space 4 your projects

2. We started to put the theory here to, on the main folder FCKinsubria, and starting Architettura too

     -For Programmazione, Matteo Digosciu is doing the teorical work, go to Teoria programazione,
     will be composed by a README with all the args that we need to study 4 the test.

     Each subject is divided in folders, with a doc.txt explaning the teory, and after a pratical
    exemple.

    - For Architettura, Murilo Faleiros is doing the teorical work, go to Teoria Architetura.
